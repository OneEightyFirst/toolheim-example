notes: |
  Daggers - +1 Enemy armour save: Daggers are not the best weapons to use for penetrating an enemy model’s armour. An enemy wounded by a dagger gains a +1 bonus to his armour save, and a 6+ armour save if he has none normally.															
	Two-handed - A model armed with a double-handed weapon may not use a shield, buckler or additional weapon in close combat. If the model is equipped with a shield he will still get a +1 bonus to his armour save against shooting.  
  Strike last - Double-handed weapons are so heavy that the model using them always strikes last, even when charging.
  Parry - Swords offer an excellent balance of defence and offence. A model armed with a sword may parry blows. When his opponent rolls to hit, the model armed with a sword may roll a D6. If the score is greater than the highest to hit score of his opponent, the model has parried the blow, and that attack is discarded. A model may not parry attacks made with double or more its own Strength – they are simply too powerful to be stopped.   																
	Save modifier - Pistols are even better at penetrating armour than their Strength value of 4 suggests. A model wounded by a pistol must take its armour save with a -2 modifier.
  Hand-to-hand - Pistols can be used in hand-to-hand combat as well as for shooting. A model armed with a pistol and another close combat weapon gains +1 Attack, which is resolved at Strength 4 with a -2 save modifier. This bonus attack can be used only once per combat. If you are firing a brace of pistols, your model can fight with 2 Attacks in the first turn of close combat. These attacks are resolved with a model’s Weapon Skill like any normal close combat attack and likewise may be parried. Successful hits are resolved at Strength 4 and with a -2 save modifier, regardless of the firer’s Strength.																	
  Move or fire - You may not move and fire a crossbow on the same turn, other than to pivot on the spot to face your target or to stand up.
